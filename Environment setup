#Environment Setup

Term 1 of the course will require Python 2, Python 3, OpenCV, MoviePy and juptyer. 

# OS Choice - Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS. 

The environment can also be build on Windows with Docker. 
I had a lot of issues with Docker setup and found Ubuntu to be a much smoother option. 

Step 1: Getting setup with Python
I used Anaconda to install everything using the terminal. 
Downloading and install the Anaconda Python 3 distribution from Continuum Analytics "https://www.continuum.io/downloads"

Use the following command in the terminal to install create a new environment with Python 3. 

> conda create --name=yourNewEnvironment python=3 anaconda
> source activate yourNewEnvironment

Step 2: Installing OpenCV
Once you have Anaconda installed, first double check you are in your Python 3 environment:
>python
Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.1.1 (x86_64)| (default, Jul 2 2016, 17:52:12)
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 4.2 (clang-425.0.28)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
(Ctrl-d to exit Python)
run the following command at the terminal prompt to get OpenCV:
> conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
then to test if OpenCV is installed correctly:
> python
>>> import cv2
>>>
(Ctrl-d to exit Python)

Step 3: Installing moviepy
Moviepy package is for processing video in this project 
To install moviepy run:
>pip install moviepy
and check that the install worked:
>python
>>>import moviepy
>>>
(Ctrl-d to exit Python)

Step 4: Opening the code in a Jupyter Notebook
You will complete this project in a Jupyter notebook.
Anaconda comes with jupyter. Test it out with the following command. 

> jupyter notebook
A browser window will appear showing the contents of the current directory.
